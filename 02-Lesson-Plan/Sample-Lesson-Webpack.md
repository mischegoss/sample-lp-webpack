# XX.X Sample Lesson Plan: Webpack

## Overview 

Today's lesson introduces students to bundling JavaScript code with Webpack as well as the implementation of Dev Server for live reloading. The benefits of performance optimization and Progressive Web Applications are also discussed. 

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `01-Ins_Modularization` through `06-Stu_Dev-Server`.

* Encourage students to refer to the [Webpack documentation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/), as needed, to reinforce their understanding of key concepts. 

* The `01-Ins_Modularization` directory includes two demo files. The first Instructor demo is a simple front-end project using the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript structure students have used in prior projects. The second Instructor demo includes the same project optimized for use with Webpack. It may be useful to provide both of these demos to the students to help reinforce how they can convert an existing project to use Webpack.   

* Since these demos use a small codebase, it may not be immediately evident how JavaScript bundling can improve an app's performance. Remind students that in the workplace, projects are much bigger and often have many contributors and encourage them to `think big` when considering the benefits of Webpack. 

* Webpack is a robust tool that also be used to bundle HTML, CSS, and other assets. Stress to the students that while today's focus is on bundling JavaScript files, these additional uses -- as well as `import` and `export` syntax -- will be explored in the next lessons.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Create a basic Webpack configuration file

* Bundle JavaScript code into a single file using Webpack

* Handle third-party JavaScript libraries using client-side NPM packages

* Implement Webpack's Dev Server for live reloading

* @TODO [Unit XX Slide Deck]()

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Open the [slide deck]() and follow these prompts on their corresponding slides:

  * **@TODO TITLE OF SLIDE**: @TODO ADD TALKING POINTS

  * **@TODO TITLE OF SLIDE**: @TODO ELABORATE ON SLIDE CONTENT
  
  * **@TODO TITLE OF SLIDE**: @TODO TRANSITION INTO MINI-PROJECT DEMO

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 2. Instructor Demo: Modularization (5 min) 

* Open `01-Ins_Modularization-Example/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë Instead of using one large JavaScript file, we can use a different JavaScript file to handle the functionality for each box on the page. 

  * üîë This modularization allows us to break down our JavaScript into small, more manageable chunks of code that perform a specific role.

* Open `01-Ins_Modularization-Example/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë To use multiple JavaScript files, we can link each individual file to our HTML. This works but it is difficult to maintain as our projects grow in scope. 

    ```html
    <script src="assets/js/box-one.js"></script>
    <script src="assets/js/box-two.js"></script>
    <script src="assets/js/box-three.js"></script>
    <script src="assets/js/box-four.js"></script>
    ```
  
* Open `01-Ins_Webpack-Example/` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * üîë To write cleaner, faster code, we can use Webpack to bundle our JavaScript modules.   

  * üîë To use Webpack, we first need to initialize npm and create a `package.json` file. To do that, we use `npm init -y`.

    ```sh
    npm init -y
    ```

  * üîë Next, we install Webpack locally as well as the command line tools. Since we want to use Webpack during development only, we use `--save-dev`.

    ```sh
    npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
    ```

* Open `01-Ins_Webpack-Example/src` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * When we look at the file structure for our project, we now have a `package.json` at the root. We also have two new directories we use to hold Webpack's input and output.

  * üîë We use the `src` directory -- our input directory -- to hold the files we want Webpack to bundle. For now, all of our JavaScript files go into our `src`.

* Open `01-Ins_Webpack-Example/src/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë We also have a new file in our `src`, an `index.js`. This JavaScript file will serve as Webpack's entry point. 

  * üîë When we run Webpack, it will check everything that has been imported or required in the `index.js` entry point and then bundle it all together into a new file called `main.js`. 

    ```js
    import './box-one';
    import './box-two';
    import './box-three';
    import './box-four';
    ```

 * üîë The single `main.js` file will then be added -- by Webpack -- into the `dist` folder. 

* Open `01-Ins_Webpack-Example/dist` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë The `dist` directory contains all the files Webpack outputs. For mow, that is the `main.js` file. 
  
  * Since we are only generating a JavaScript bundle for now, we also  put our `index.html` and `styles.css` file manually in this directory. Later, we will use Webpack to output all these files.

* Open `01-Ins_Webpack-Example/dist/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë Now that we used Webpack to bundle our JavaScript files into a single `main.js` file, we no longer need links to multiple JavaScript files. Instead, we can simply link to the newly generated `main.js` file. 

    ```html
    <script src="main.js"></script>
    ```

* Open `01-Ins_Webpack-Example/webpack.config.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë This is all we need for Webpack to bundle our files for a simple project. However, for more complex projects, it is important to use a configuration file explicitly state the entry point and output expected. 

    ```js
    const path = require('path');

    module.exports = {
      entry: './src/index.js',
      output: {
       filename: 'main.js',
       path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
      },
      mode: 'development'
    };
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the benefit of breaking our JavaScript into small, more manageable modules? 

  * üôã In a large-scale project, using one large JavaScript file makes it difficult to maintain the code. Using smaller JavaScript 'chunks' that perform a single task makes it easier for developers to debug and work with the codebase.  

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What does Webpack do with these modules? 

  * üôã Webpack bundles all the modules needed for their project to run -- and their dependencies -- into a single JavaScript file. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Modularization/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: Modularization (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Modularization/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.
